# Housing_ML
This is an end to end machine learning project
I used a public dataset called Housing
Steps folowed on this project:
1.- Data exploration
2.- Search null values 
3.- Graphic analysis for numeric variables
4.- Corr matrix 
5.- Feature engineering
6.- Use of pipelines and column transformer to process features
7.- Models used: Linear Regression, Decision Tree and RandomForest
8.- Metrics to measure model performance - RMSE, mean and Std Dev
9.- Select a model and save it in a pickle extension
